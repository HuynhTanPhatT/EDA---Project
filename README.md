# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects
# Overview
This repository contains a collection of my personal Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. Each project involves exploring various datasets to gain insights, uncover patterns, and visualize trends.
#Project
Hacker New Community EDA
With the explosive of growth in computer , there are lots of communities on online to help you searching and studying, for instance: *StackOverFlow, Reddit, dev.to, and HackerNew*. In this project, i am going to work as a Data Analyst to analyze "Hacker New" dataset. My aim for this project is to determine:
- The potential hours to post in Hacker News Community
- Which type of post is more common in the community: Ask HN or Show HN?

NYC Taxi EDA
Thesedays, with the high population density in New York City (NYC), for-hire vehicles have become a convenient and comfortable option for people who need to travel, who do not own a car,want to avoid finding parking lot, commute for work or study. In this project, i am going to work as a Data Analyst to explore and analyze a small "NYC Taxi" dataset.
The purpose of this EDA is to determine:
- How many taxi trips were taken in a particular month?
- Which is the busiest airport?
- What are the averages for trip distance, trip length, and total amount for rides under a particular speed?
